            <p>This is a project I created for food company ‘Rough Pickings’, celebrating their love of fresh food
              and caribbean flavours. This site was designed to champion the food imagery. The client’s desire was
              to leave the audience drooling and wanting to sample the food. I think this format does just that. </p>

            <p>This was a simple portfolio site put together to show off the web design work of a junior web developer.
              The simple one page style format allows the audience to easily navigate the client’s work and contact her.</p>

            <p>This is a landing page I created for a personal bakery business. Complete with logo and branding, this
              package was whipped with the client’s wants to project a bright fun happy feminine energy to her audience.</p>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <h4>Well designed websites make my heart sing</h4>
          <p>As a self diagnosed web addict, I have seen more than enough painful to use websites. If only someone made this easier to use,
            I'd sigh exasperately time and time again. After taking Skillcrush's 'Break Into Tech' blueprint, I now realised
            that 'someone' is me! As a graphic designer working in London I have the eye for what makes a good looking website,
            and as user I know what makes them good to use. I am eager to take these skills and put them to good use.
            When I’m not writing code, I’m writing for my blog <a href="http://shesupandaway.com/" target="_blank">She’s Up and Away</a>.
            When I’m not doing either of those, you can find me hoarding pens and card stock in a hobby craft near you.</p>
